## Parsers

Implementing a hand-written recursive descent parser and generated ones with the help of &nbsp; *Java*, &nbsp;*Java CUP* &nbsp;and &nbsp;*JFlex*.

### Project structure
- **Recursive Descent Parser /** Contains the LL(1) grammar of a simple bitwise AND(&), XOR(^) calculator and the implementation of the recursive descent parser that parses the code and evaluates the answer.

- **Generated Parser /** Contains the lexical analyzer ( implemented with *Jflex* ) and the parser generator ( implemented with *Java CUP* ) for an input language that supports strings. The parser takes input the language and converts it to Java, ready for compilation and execution.

*- Compilation and execution istructions included in the folders above*
